Using the attached dataset of select demographic and socioeconomic variables derived from the CDC/ATSDR’s social vulnerability index, conduct an analysis of the census tracts within your city and present key insights basedon your analysis.<br>\n",

    "### Summary\n",
    "Though the analysis provided data at the census tract level, I focused my analysis on the municipal-level data. While census tracts provide a level of granularity, neighborhoods and municipalities are more meaningful to residents and end-users. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods:\n",
    " - Filtering on Allegheny County reduced the data to 380 census tracts\n",
    " - Used University of Pittsburgh's datasets of [Allegheny County]('https://pitt.libguides.com/uscensus/alleghenycotracts') and [City of Pittsburgh]('https://pitt.libguides.com/pghcensus/pghcensustracts') to map census tracts to municipalities within Allegheny County.\n",
    " - Allegheny County contains 120 municipalities.\n",
    " - Four census tracts were omitted from by the merge, due to being dropped from the 2020 census tract definitions.\n",
    " - Discovered that a handful of census tracts map to multiple municipalties. Those municipalities were combined for the sake of this analysis.\n",

    "### Data (at the tract level):\n",
    "The numeric variables in the dataset were:\n",
    " - Population\n",

    " - Population living at or below the 150% poverty line\n",
    " - BIPOC Residents\n",
    " - Households with no vehicle\n",
    " - Percent of Overcrowded Housing Units\n",
    " - People 25+ w/o high school diploma\n",
    " - used the % overcrowded to calculate the number overcrowded housing units\n",

    "### Aggregation (at the municiaplity level)\n",
    " - Aggregated(sum) each column at the municipality level \n",

    "    - Individual level:\n",
    "        - Percent of population living at or below 150% the poverty line\n",
    "        - Percent of population who identify as BIPOC\n",
    "        - Percent of population over 25 without a high school diploma\n",
